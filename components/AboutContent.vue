          “What does a counsellor/psychotherapist do?” is one of the most
          difficult question for a therapist to respond to. Simply answering “I
          listen” does not do a therapist justice. Therapist's do in deed listen
          but they do so in a scientific, very deliberate and structured way
          which in turn enables the client to explore aspects of their life and
          an opportunity to express difficult feelings such as anger,
          resentment, guilt and fear in a confidential and safe environment."
