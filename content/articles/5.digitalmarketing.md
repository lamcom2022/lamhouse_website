## Product Features

A team consisting of 13 Senior managers from Al Jabr Laundries (Saudi Arabia) took part of an intensive “on-the-job” Retail Textile Cleaning Workshop organized by CINET’s World of PTC – Business School Program in Ryiadh (Aug 23-28, 2019).

The entire group participated at practical assignments and the learning process during the week, for each of the 3 levels in the Business School curricula for Retail Textile Cleaning (RTC): Starters (Level C), Operational Excellence (Level B) and Management (Level A).

The learning process was coordinated by Mr. Wim Meijer, Senior Trainer RTC and it was followed by the final exams. The Al Jabr team passed successfully the exams, allowing each one of the trainees to obtain a “Master in PTC” Certificate for Retail Textile Cleaning.
